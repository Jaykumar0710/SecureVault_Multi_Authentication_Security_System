# 🔐 SecureVault – Multi-Authentication Security System

SecureVault is a robust and modular Spring Boot web application that provides multiple layers of authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) using Spring Security. This system is designed to demonstrate real-world user authentication, secure session handling, and access management based on roles such as ADMIN, USER, and MANAGER.

2. 🔐 Secure password storage using BCrypt hashing
3. 🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for route and content protection
4. 🔑 Form-based login with Spring Security
5. 📄 Thymeleaf templates for responsive frontend pages
6. 🧩 Custom `UserDetailsService` and DAO Authentication Provider
7. 💾 MySQL database integration for user and role management
8. 🚪 Logout support with redirection
9. 📈 Clean, modular project structure for scalability and integration

> ⚙️ Future planned features (next phases):
> - OTP authentication via email (2FA)
